Since I started using it a year ago, it has become a part of my everyday toolbelt. </p>\n<p>In the developer community, utilities like postman have become quite popular. Besides providing a solution for quickly testing out HTTP APIs, such tools also facilitate managing of collections. One great thing about postman collections is that they can be templated through variables. While the UI for managing these variables is a bit clunky, it provides a simple way to use the sample collection for multiple environments.</p>\n<p>This post outlines a simple solution to collection management by composing together a few more open source utilities.</p>\n<p>The directory structure of our collection will look like following (We are using the shopify API as an example): </p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs plaintext\">api-collection\n|_ order-admin-api\n|   |_ variables.yaml\n|   |_ invocations\n|        |_ fetch-order-by-id.sh\n|        |_ fetch-order-by-date-range.sh\n|_ fulfillment-admin-api\n|   |_ variables.yaml\n|   |_ invocations\n|        |_ fetch-fulfillments-by-order-id.sh\n|_ varaibles.yaml</code></pre>\n\n<p>We have a directory for each endpoint, and invocations directory contains </p>\n",
