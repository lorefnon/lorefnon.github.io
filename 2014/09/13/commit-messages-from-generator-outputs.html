This makes skimming through commit logs later easier because generators often generate many files upfront that wouldn&#39;t be edited until much later. So the subsequent commit wouldn&#39;t be littered with changes that aren&#39;t directly related to the actual operation mentioned in the commit message. Also while browsing through commit diffs keeping generated code in their own commits speeds up the reviewing process - because in most cases we already have an idea of what the generated could be, so it can be skipped.</p>
<p>Now, if you use well designed frameworks with elegant command line interfaces, like Rails then the actual command typed along with the command output eg.</p>
<pre><code>rails generate model post title:string body:text

invoke  active_record
create    db/migrate/20140913191020_create_posts.rb
create    app/models/post.rb
invoke    rspec
create      spec/models/post_spec.rb
</code></pre>
<p>is expressive enough for a commit message. A person familiar enough with the framework can instantly see the above and know what happened there. In such case, spending time writing an explanatory commit message for a auto-generated code is pretty much a waste of time.</p>
<p>So I have created a simple zsh function which does exactly the above:</p>
<pre><code>GC ()
&#123;
  cmd=&quot;$@&quot;
  output=$(&quot;$@&quot;)
  git add .
  git commit -m &quot;$cmd&quot; -m &quot;$output&quot;
&#125;
</code></pre>
<p>Add it to your zshrc, and next time you can simply type :</p>
<pre><code>GC rails g model comment body:text commenter:string
</code></pre>
<p>GC will add all the generated code (please ensure you have a clean state before running the generator - GC will not help you that) and committing it with the message as the command combined with the output of generator in separate paragraphs.</p>
